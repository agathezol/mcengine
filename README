						Installation Instructions

1)	type "make"
2)	move 'mcengine' and 'mcengine.cfg' into your minecraft server installation
3)  edit mcengine.cfg to change "serverJar" to the current jar you run for a server
4)  change "javaArgs" to your current java server arguments list


						   Running Instructions

1)	execute: './mcengine' inside the minecraft server directory


						          Notes

The mcengine is designed to keep minecraft running and restart it when it 
crashes. It has been tested but only in a single test environment. If you
encounter a bug or issue with the program and want me to resolve it please
send me a core file of the running program (you can get one with gcore) and
a copy of your binary so I can get a stack trace from it. Thanks!
